🔹 What is this?

I’m building a low-cost color sensing system using an RGB LED and an LDR.
The idea is to sequentially illuminate a surface with red, green, and blue light and measure reflected intensity to identify colors.
It basically works like a human eye, detecting RGB reflections and determining the surface color.

🔹 Why?

Commercial color sensors are expensive and opaque.
This project explores how much can be achieved with basic components, calibration, and software logic.
The fun part is that all the components used are super ubiquitous and affordable, so anyone can make it.
